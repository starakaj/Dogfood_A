Dogfood A: Trying to make some interesting visuals

So here I am in Max. I'm feeling inspired, though I don't necessarily have any idea how to get started. 

Maybe, I think, I'll go for a living Basquiat type style. That could be interesting--2D shapes sticking out and shifting somewhat non-deterministically.

I make a patch.

All I need to do, I figure, is set up a scene in openGL, throw some shit in it and start moving my camera around.

! Okay, one thing I notice right away that's super annoying is that every time I want to save the state of a jitter object, I have to make an attrui object for it, then name that attrui, then double-check that the state of the jitter object is actually saved. That's not cool. Oh, wait, pattr doesn't support attrui. Are you fucking kidding me? Then how do I save the state of a jitter object?

In any case, I've now got a very simple patch that illustrates throwing two planes into an openGL scene, and then moving the camera around a bit to demonstrate parallax
