Eating our own dogfood, chapter 1: Trying to make some interesting visuals.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here I am in Max. I'm feeling inspired, though I don't necessarily have any idea how to get started. 

Maybe, I think, I'll go for a living Basquiat type style. That could be interesting--2D shapes sticking out and shifting somewhat non-deterministically.

I make a patch.
